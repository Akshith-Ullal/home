<h2>Mapping of gestures between local and remote environments in mixed/augmented reality</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we describe our framework for mapping a user’s gestural interactions from their environment to that of their avatar’s. Gestural interactions can be 
  divided into two types: i) positional interactions and ii) pointing interactions. Positional interactions are interactions where the user has physical contact with an 
  object in their environment. For example, picking cup a chess piece. Pointing interactions are interactions where the user points at a particular object in their environment.
   Both these interactions need to be mapped onto the user’s avatar, in its environment, such that the interaction has its original intended meaning. </p>
<h2>Mapping of naturalistic locomotion paths between local and remote environments in mixed/augmented reality</h2>
<p>Remote mixed reality (RMR) allows users to be present and interact in other users’ environments through their photorealistic avatars. Common interaction objects are 
  placed on surfaces in each user's environments and interacting with these objects require users to walk towards them. However, since the user's and their avatar's room's 
  spatial configuration are not exactly similar, for a particular user's walking path, an equivalent path must be found in the avatar's environment, according to its 
  environment's spatial configuration. In this work, we use the concept of mesh deformation to obtain this path, where we deform the mesh associated with the user's 
  environment to fit to the spatial configuration of the avatar's environment. This gives us the corresponding mapping of every point between the two environments 
  from which the equivalent path can be generated.</p>
<h2>Redirection of locomotion paths for obstacle avoidance in remote augmented/mixed reality</h2>
<p>Obstacles in the context of remote-local AR scenarios are non-walkable spaces that consist of no interactable objects and have no equivalence in the user’s environment.  
  Therefore, they do not serve any function from the perspective of mapping the user’s interaction from their environment to that of the avatar’s. However, the presence of 
  obstacles can cause problems during mapping of locomotion between environments. First, obstacles can be of any irregular shapes and can occur in any configurations. Although 
  many obstacles that appear in everyday room environments such as tables, chairs and other furniture have regular geometric shapes, they can occur together sometimes to create 
  irregular shapes as shown in Fig. 4-2. Second, obstacles can be in either the avatar’s or the user’s environment and may not have any corresponding equivalent objects between the environments. 
  This non-correspondence between the user’s and avatar’s environment can make the computation when finding equivalent paths complex. This is because the 
  obstacles in both the user’s and the avatar’s environments need to be considered which is unlike the case with furniture objects that will likely have 
  corresponding equivalence in both the environments. Moreover, we have presented the case for only two environments, i.e., the user’s and the avatar’s. However, it is likely 
  that multiple users would be present in the interaction, where the equivalent locomotion mapping would get even more complicated.  Thus, it is of great importance to find walkable 
  paths that avoid obstacles. In this chapter, we propose an approach to finding equivalent path through a mapping between the user and their avatar’s environments that avoid obstacles.

<h2>
  Older and Younger Adult Perceptions towards HMD based Telepresence Interaction in Collaborative AR</h2>
  <p>This project involves developing collaborative activities in remote augmented reality that are adapted to the needs of older adults at long-term care (LTC) settings. The long term goal is for their friends and family to remotely interact with them via 3D virtual visits in AR through their photorealistic avatars. The hypothesis is that the immersive and collaborative nature of the interaction with loved ones will promote social connectedness and mitigate loneliness. The project follows an iterative approach of prototyping and refining activities in AR, with inputs from all involved stakeholders, including staff and family members of the older adults at LTC settings.</p>
