<p align="justify">The above figures show mapping of user's gestures from remote to local environemnts (and vice versa) for avatar based telepresence interactions. Gestural interactions can be 
  divided into two types: i) positional interactions (Fig. 1) and ii) pointing interactions (Fig. 2). Positional interactions are interactions where the user has physical contact with an 
  object in their environment. For example, picking cup a chess piece. Pointing interactions are interactions where the user points at a particular object in their environment.
   Both these interactions need to be mapped onto the user’s avatar, in its environment, such that the interaction has its original intended meaning while also preserving the original nonverbal bodypose behavior. During my 
  PhD, I proposed a Multiobjective optimization approach using genetic algorithms to solve this problem for both <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9drgJpYwI6A">contact</a> and <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SoQeRj6p_M">pointing gestures</a>. </p>


<h2>Mapping of naturalistic locomotion paths between local and remote environments in mixed/augmented reality</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="./images/locomotionredirectionproject.PNG" alt="The figure shows the case of equivalent walking paths that need to be generated due to dissimilarities between User1 and User2's environments" class="center" width=40% 
  height=27%>
  <figcaption>Fig. 3: The above figure shows the case of equivalent walking paths that need to be generated due to dissimilarities in the granddaughter, User1 and older adult, User2's environments. 
    (a) Represents one of the likely paths User1 may take along vertex points ABCDE to sit on the sofa to chat with User1s avatar in User2s environment. (b) Represents the equivalent path A'B'C'D'E' in User1’s 
    environment of the User2s path ABCDE after path deformation to reach the sofa. Note: The equivalent path A'B'C'D'E' is longer and hence the avatars speed in (b) needs to be higher than in (a), 
    to reach the vertex E’ as the user in (a) reaches E. Our solution is to use the concept of <a href ="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3562939.3565665">mesh deformation</a>. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p align="justify">Remote mixed reality (RMR) allows users to be present and interact in other users’ environments through their photorealistic avatars. Common interaction objects are 
  placed on surfaces in each user's environments and interacting with these objects require users to walk towards them. However, since the user's and their avatar's room's 
  spatial configuration are not exactly similar, for a particular user's walking path, an equivalent path must be found in the avatar's environment, according to its 
  environment's spatial configuration (Fig. 3). During my PhD, I <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h_z-2WbFI0">proposed</a> the use of the concept of mesh deformation to obtain this path, where we deform the mesh associated with the user's 
  environment to fit to the spatial configuration of the avatar's environment. This gives us the corresponding mapping of every point between the two environments 
  from which the equivalent path can be generated. The generated equivalent path serves as a reference for the avatar to follow. It needs to be modulated to fit naturalistic constraints, which are an active area of my ongoing research..</p>
<h2>Redirection of locomotion paths for obstacle avoidance in remote augmented/mixed reality</h2>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/obstacleavoidanceproject.PNG" alt="The figure shows a special case of Fig. 3, i.e., the problem of obstacles in a remote-local AR scenario. " class="center">
  <figcaption>Fig. 4: The above figure shows a special case of Fig. 3, i.e., the problem of obstacles in a remote-local AR scenario. (a) shows one of the paths ABCDE the User1 (granddaughter) can take in her environment to reach the sofa. 
    (b) shows the redirected path A'B'C'D'E', User1’s avatar must follow to reach the sofa. However, the path A'B'C'D'E' needs to be modified to take into account the obstacle represented by the dining chairs 
    represents in User2’s environment to prevent unnaturalistic interaction. During my PhD, I proposed an ellipse based solution that can modify the path smoothly around any irregularly shaped obstacle.   

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p align="justify">Obstacles in the context of remote-local AR scenarios are non-walkable spaces that consist of no interactable objects and have no equivalence in the user’s environment.  
  Therefore, they do not serve any function from the perspective of mapping the user’s interaction from their environment to that of the avatar’s. However, the presence of 
  obstacles can cause problems during mapping of locomotion between environments. First, obstacles can be of any irregular shapes and can occur in any configurations. Although 
  many obstacles that appear in everyday room environments such as tables, chairs and other furniture have regular geometric shapes, they can occur together sometimes to create 
  irregular shapes as shown in Fig. 4. Second, obstacles can be in either the avatar’s or the user’s environment and may not have any corresponding equivalent objects between the environments. 
  This non-correspondence between the user’s and avatar’s environment can make the computation when finding equivalent paths complex. This is because the 
  obstacles in both the user’s and the avatar’s environments need to be considered which is unlike the case with furniture objects that will likely have 
  corresponding equivalence in both the environments. Moreover, we have presented the case for only two environments, i.e., the user’s and the avatar’s. However, it is likely 
  that multiple users would be present in the interaction, where the equivalent locomotion mapping would get even more complicated.  Thus, it is of great importance to find walkable 
  paths that avoid obstacles. During my PhD, I proposed an approach to finding equivalent path through a mapping between the user and their avatar’s environments that avoids any iregularly shaped obstacles.

<h2>
  Older and Younger Adult Perceptions towards HMD based Telepresence Interaction in Collaborative AR</h2>
  <figure>
    <img src="/images/remoteartelepresenceinteraction.PNG" alt="AR telepresence system" class="center" width=40% 
    height=30%>
    <figcaption>Fig. 5: An example setup of a sample activity. An older adult, User1, is able to experience her granddaughter, User2, through her photorealistic avatar in her environement (left). 
      Similarly, User1 is represented in User2’s environement through her photorealistic avatar (right). Users’ interactions have been mapped to their respective avatars.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p align="justify">The aim of this project is to obtain the perceptions of older adults, with younger adults being the control when interacting with a photorealistic avatar of a remote user. In addition to their perception, we are also interested to know whether full body emotions and gestures expressed through the avatar are discernable to the older adults. The system involves real-time bidirectional communication of the participants with a remote user and was developed using Unity game engine. The facial and body expressions are captured and transferred across the network using a ZeroMQ distributed computing architecture.

    Iterative Participatory Design of Collaborative AR Activities for older adults at long-term care (LTC) settings</h2>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Fig. 6: An older adult picking up a checkers piece in AR. An iterative participatory design was used to understand the needs of older adults for developing collaborative AR activities for them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p align="justify">This project involves developing collaborative activities in remote augmented reality that are adapted to the needs of older adults at long-term care (LTC) settings. The long term goal is for their friends and family to remotely interact with them via 3D virtual visits in AR through their photorealistic avatars. The hypothesis is that the immersive and collaborative nature of the interaction with loved ones will promote social connectedness and mitigate loneliness. The project follows an iterative approach of prototyping and refining activities in AR, with inputs from all involved stakeholders, including staff and family members of the older adults at LTC settings.
