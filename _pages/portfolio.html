<h2>
  Older and Younger Adult Perceptions towards HMD based Telepresence Interaction in Collaborative AR</h2>
  <p>This project involves developing collaborative activities in remote augmented reality that are adapted to the needs of older adults at long-term care (LTC) settings. The long term goal is for their friends and family to remotely interact with them via 3D virtual visits in AR through their photorealistic avatars. The hypothesis is that the immersive and collaborative nature of the interaction with loved ones will promote social connectedness and mitigate loneliness. The project follows an iterative approach of prototyping and refining activities in AR, with inputs from all involved stakeholders, including staff and family members of the older adults at LTC settings.</p>
