I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) PhD candidate at the [Robotics and Autonomous Systems Lab](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/rasl/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). My research is focused on developing motion planning algorithms using optimization and machine learning techniques that efficiently and naturalistically  map locomotion and human-object interactions between remote environments in Mixed Reality. The goal is to have realistic, collaborative [telepresence-like interaction](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2022/vanderbilt-researcher-receives-nearly-2-7-million-in-nsf-and-nih-funding-to-explore-how-augmented-reality-can-ease-loneliness-in-older-adults/), that is able to simulate in-person interactions through life-sized photorealistic avatars. I also work on developing intelligent human computer/ robot systems for vulnerable populations of older adults and individuals with autism using physiological sensing, signal processing and machine learning techniques.
