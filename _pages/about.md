I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) PhD candidate at the [Robotics and Autonomous Systems Lab](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/rasl/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). My research is focused on developing motion planning algorithms using [optimization and machine learning techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGTkYm9YuL8&t=1s) that efficiently and naturalistically  map [locomotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h_z-2WbFI0) and [human-object interactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9drgJpYwI6A) between remote environments in Mixed Reality (MR). The goal is to have realistic, collaborative [telepresence-like interaction](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2022/vanderbilt-researcher-receives-nearly-2-7-million-in-nsf-and-nih-funding-to-explore-how-augmented-reality-can-ease-loneliness-in-older-adults/), that is able to simulate in-person interactions through life-sized photorealistic avatars. I also work on developing data-driven human computer/ robot systems for vulnerable populations of older adults and individuals with autism using physiological sensing, signal processing, and machine learning techniques. 

My primary research interests lie in the fields of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), data science, machine learning, AI, graphics, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I am fortunate to have been advised by [Nilanjan Sarkar](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/nilanjan-sarkar) during my PhD and [Marjorie Skubic](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/marjorie-skubic/) during my master's degree.
