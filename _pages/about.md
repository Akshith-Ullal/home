I am a Research Engineer at the [University of Florida's Intelligent Clinical Care Center (IC3)](https://ic3.center.ufl.edu/). My research focuses on developing AI-enabled avatar-human and avatar-scene interactions in Mixed Reality. I also work on developing explainable AI algorithms to enhance the interpretability of ML models, particularly in the healthcare field.

I completed my PhD at the [Robotics and Autonomous Systems Lab](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/rasl/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). My research there focused on developing motion planning algorithms using [optimization and machine learning techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGTkYm9YuL8&t=1s) that efficiently and naturalistically  map [locomotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h_z-2WbFI0) and [human-object interactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9drgJpYwI6A) between remote environments in Mixed Reality (MR). The goal was to achieve realistic, collaborative [telepresence-like interaction](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2022/vanderbilt-researcher-receives-nearly-2-7-million-in-nsf-and-nih-funding-to-explore-how-augmented-reality-can-ease-loneliness-in-older-adults/), that is able to simulate in-person interactions through life-sized photorealistic avatars. 

I am fortunate to have been advised by [Nilanjan Sarkar](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/nilanjan-sarkar) during my PhD and [Marjorie Skubic](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/marjorie-skubic/) during my master's degree.
